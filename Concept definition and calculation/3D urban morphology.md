| Variance coefficient equals the standard deviation of height divided by the mean height of specific elements (buildings, vegetation, etc.) within an area. The indicator is sometimes referred to as _otherness_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                       |                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |            |
| Nearest neighbor distance is defined as the shortest straight-line distance between the focal element and its nearest neighbor of the same type using simple Euclidean geometry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                       |                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |            |

| Fractal dimension index reflects shape complexity across a range of spatial scales. There are two methods for the calculation of the indicator. One is derived from _perimeter-area fractal dimension_ in landscape metrics. However, it is only meaningful if the log-log relationship between perimeter and area is linear over the full range of element sizes. Another method is to calculate the average fractal dimension of elements within an area. |                                       |                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |            |

| Shannon's evenness index quantifies evenness of the distribution of area for specific elements.
